# Troubleshooting Framework

1. **Identify the problem and urgency**
   - Gather information (5 W's), question the user, identify symptoms, and determine if anything has changed.
   - What is the deadline/urgency (class starting, meeting in progress, health emergency)?

2. **Establish a theory of probable cause**
   - Work through the OSI model, starting with the Physical Layer.

3. **Test the theory to determine the cause**
   - Confirm the theory; if confirmed, move to the next step. If not, establish a new theory or escalate.

4. **Establish a plan of action and implement the solution**
   - Create a plan to fix the issue, considering potential impacts, and implement the solution or escalate.

5. **Verify full system functionality and implement preventive measures**
   - Ensure the solution works and take steps to prevent the issue from recurring.
   - Educate the end user.

6. **Document findings, actions, and outcomes**
   - Record the problem, the solution, and any lessons learned in Service Now/Ticketing System for future reference.
